## Introduction

These are the Advanced Scratch Sushi Cards, and in them you’ll be making a platform-style game to which you can later add your own levels, powers, and characters.

### What you will make

Did you know that having lots and lots of cows contributes to climate change? That's because cows produce methane, a greenhouse gas, and fart it out. In this game your mission is to catch as much of the methane as you can.
